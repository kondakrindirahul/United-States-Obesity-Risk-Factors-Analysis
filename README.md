# United-States-Obesity-Risk-Factors-Analysis
* The objective of this project is exploring the relation between obesity and risk factors such as Fitness, Nutrition as well as demographic factors such as Education, Race and Income.
* The **Nutrition, Physical Activity and Obesity - Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System** dataset for this project is provided by Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
* This data set contains information about the obesity, fitness and nutritional trends in the United States of America.
* State wise data for Degree of Education, Race, Income is obtained from wikipedia and formed into a dataset. This is the **Demographic Factors** dataset.
* Different clustering algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Hierarchial clustering are applied on both the datasets
and the results of clustering are plotted on USA map using choropleth maps provided by **plotly**.
* The clustering results have been subject to dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to plot the clusters in a **2-Dimensional Scatter Plot**.
* The CDC Risk factors dataset and the Demographic factors DataSet are compared by using the visualizations provided by United Stated Maps and the 2-D Scatter Plots.
